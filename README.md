# Logistic-Regression
*Logistic Regression is a “Supervised machine learning” algorithm that can be used to model the probability of a certain class or event. It is used when the data is linearly separable and the outcome is binary or dichotomous in nature.
That means Logistic regression is usually used for Binary classification problems.

*Binary Classification refers to predicting the output variable that is discrete in two classes.

*Types of Logistic Regression
  -Simple Logistic Regression: a single independent is used to predict the output
  -Multiple logistic regression: multiple independent variables are used to predict the output
